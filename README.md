# TextGen
A pseudo-random text generator using simple Markov modelling.

This is a C++ implementation for this [assignment](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring17/cos126/assignments/markov.html), a part of Princeton University's CS course - COS126.

# To Run
Compile MarkovChains.cpp, and run the executable. (C++ 11 options must be enabled while compiling. In gcc, do "gcc -std=c++11 MarkovChains.cpp".)

Input the complete filename (with a "\_inp.txt" extension, which will be replaced by a "\_out.txt" extension). 

Note, the filename must be in the current directory as the executable.
